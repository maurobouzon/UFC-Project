In this project, I utilized R and rvest to scrape data from "ufcstats.com". Tidyverse aided in data manipulation.

Using rvest, I extracted event details, fighter information, and fight statistics.

With tidyverse, I cleaned the data, revealing insights into UFC events and fighter performances.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of web scraping with R for collecting and analyzing UFC data.
